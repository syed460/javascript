# OOPS

before Oops we have procedural programming. Dividing programm into multiple functions. This type of programming is very simple and straiteforward
SpagattiCode

In OOps, 
 It is a programming style based on the concet of objectrs.
 we group the related variables and functions into a unit and object

Variables = Properties = arguments = Nouns (adjectives)
function = methods = Verbes (actions)

## Pillers
 1. Encapsulation
 2. Abstraction
 3. Inheritance
 4. Polymorphsim

### Encapsulation:
 The code writen in the method is encapsulation

### abstraction
 The methods that are avaialbe to invoke for a class is abstraction

### Inheritance
 the child class can inherite certain methods and properties from base class.
 It helps eliminate redentant code

### Polymorphism (Many Forms)
 techniqe a entity can be used in many forms
