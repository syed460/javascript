# OOPS

before Oops we have procedural programming. Dividing programm into multiple functions. This type of programming is very simple and straiteforward
SpagattiCode

In OOps, we group the related variables and functions into a unit and object

Variables = Properties = arguments = Nouns (adjectives)
function = methods = Verbes (actions)

## Pillers
 1. Encapsulation
 2. Abstraction
 3. Inheritance
 4. Polymorphsim

### Encapsulation:
 The code writen in the method is encapsulation

### abstraction
 The methods that are avaialbe to invoke for a class is abstraction

### Inheritance
 the child class can inherite certain methods and properties from base class.
 It helps eliminate redentant code

### Polymorphism (Many Forms)
 techniqe a entity can be used in many forms
